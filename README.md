Pilgrim.io

Pilgrim is the world frist global news aggregator.  Pilgrim will pull in articles that align with your selected interests, and present them to you in an easy to read format.

However, pilgrim does more than just bring in articles from around the world, it also breaks down the barrier between you and a foreign language.  With Pilgrim's immersion slider, you can slowly start to immerse yourself in a foreign language.  As you slide the slider you start to intersperse words in your selected language.  Maybe you want to throw in some french, or that spanish article is too hard to read so you add in a bunch of spanish words? Perhaps you need a bit more of a challenge so you translate half the article to German, or maybe you just need a few italian words - just to gain some exposure.  Pilgrim can match any article to your proficiency, regardless of where that may be.
